Can Browser is an advanced Product Information Management (PIM) system for the CAN industry. It manages, compares,
shares, and updates thousands of products. The application is deployed on AWS servers and features an advanced search
engine powered by Elasticsearch. The system is built using Java & Spring Boot for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and
MySQL for the database.
Job accomplishments:
• I designed and implemented dynamic, responsive web interfaces using Angular. I created and
managed key entities such as Product, Resource, Description, and Price, establishing effective
relationships to enhance user interaction and management of thousands of products. Angular’s
advanced features, including two-way data binding and modular architecture, were utilized to
ensure an intuitive and seamless user experience.

• I utilized Spring Boot to develop and connect RESTful APIs, enabling smooth communication
between the frontend and backend. I employed Spring MVC for efficient request handling and
Spring Data JPA to manage entities like Product, Resource, Description, and Price in MySQL. I
established necessary relationships between these entities, such as one-to-many (e.g., a
Product containing multiple Resources) and many-to-one (e.g., a Price associated with a
Product), ensuring robust data management.
• I configured and integrated Elasticsearch to deliver high-performance search functionality. I
developed entities like Search Index and Search Query, setting up relationships to facilitate
rapid and precise querying of Product and Price data. This significantly enhanced search
efficiency and accuracy within the application.
• I  employed  Swagger  to  design,  document,  and  test  APIs for  entities including  Product,
Resource, Description, and Price. I created interactive and comprehensive API documentation,
ensuring clarity and consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
• Implemented email notifications using Spring Boot’s Java Mail API to automatically inform
users about updates to product details. When a product’s information (such as price or
description) was updated, the system triggered an email to relevant stakeholders, including
product managers and sales teams, ensuring they were promptly notified of changes.
• I used JUnit for thorough unit testing of both frontend and backend components, including
entities such as Product, Resource, Description, and Price. I developed and executed test
cases to ensure functionality and reliability. Additionally, I performed detailed debugging to
resolve issues and improve application stability.
• I  managed  the  deployment  process  using  PuTTY  for  secure  SSH  access.  I  handled
configuration and deployment tasks efficiently, ensuring a smooth rollout of the application. My
responsibilities  included  coordinating  deployment  processes  and  managing  entity
configurations to ensure successful implementation.
Technologies Used:
• Backend Development:
Java & Spring Boot: Built backend solutions, including data persistence, integration with
external systems, and processing for asset tracking.
Java Mail API: Implemented email functionality with secure SMTP support, including
TLS and SSL authentication.
Spring Boot: Employed for creating RESTful APIs, handling data persistence, and
implementing security measures with Spring Security.
• Database and Search :
MySQL: Managed relational data storage and optimization.
Elasticsearch: Used for advanced search capabilities, storing and querying Product and Resource details
with query strings.
• Frontend Development :
- Angular: Developed responsive, dynamic user interfaces and implemented advanced features
like reactive forms and state management (NgRx) for scalable components
•  API Management :
-  Swagger: Implemented for designing, documenting, and testing APIs, ensuring well-defined and consistent API
interactions.
• Testing and Debugging:
- JUnit: Applied for comprehensive unit testing to verify code reliability and functionality.

This is a mobile application developed using technologies such as Java as the backend, Angular as the frontend, MYSQL
as the database, and also Spring Boot, Hibernate, Ionic 3 & Oracle.
Job accomplishments:
•  I designed and implemented a comprehensive records management system using MySQL.
Created entities such as Patient, Clinician, and Exercise with appropriate relationships. For
instance, implemented one-to-many relationships where a Patient can have multiple
Exercise Assignments, and many-to-many relationships between Patient and Clinician for
efficient tracking and management of records.
• I integrated Firebase to handle scheduling and notifications. I developed entities like
Appointment and Notification, and configured relationships to link Patient and Clinician
with their respective appointments and notifications. This setup automated push
messages and email alerts, enhancing communication between clinicians and
patients.
• I integrated TokBox to facilitate video consultations. I created the Video Session entity and
established relationships between Patient and Clinician within this entity. This allowed
patients to book and connect with clinicians seamlessly through the application.
• I enabled clinicians to share exercise details, articles, and news via email. I developed
entities for Content and Communication Log, and linked them with Patient and Clinician
profiles to ensure that relevant information was delivered in a timely manner.

manage transactions, with relationships connecting payments to specific Appointments
and Patient accounts. This integration provided a secure and efficient payment process..
• I integrated the application with a remote database using Hibernate for ORM. I created
and managed entities like Patient, Clinician, Exercise, Appointment, and Notification,
ensuring efficient data retrieval and relationship management.
• I employed Java for backend development, Spring Boot for building RESTful APIs and
handling data persistence, Angular for frontend development, and Ionic 3 for hybrid mobile
app development. I utilized MySQL and Oracle for database management, and integrated
Firebase and Stripe to enhance application features and functionalities.
